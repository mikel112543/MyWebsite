            <h2>About</h2>
            <p className="first-para">I am a 23 year old graduate of Computer Systems from the University of Limerick, Ireland.
                I have had an interest int technology for as long as I can remember. From a young age, tinkering and going through and discovering the settings of our old family PC running Windows XP.
                Although playing around with the settings would usually lead to breaking something...
                However, after many years of programming and studying Computer Systems, I still use that same mentality of tinkering and experimenting as I believe it is the best way to learn from a mistake and to solve problems.
                It is this mentality that drives me to constantly learn new Software Engineering concepts and techniques as I strive to not leave a problem unsolved.</p>
            <p className="second-para">
                After completing my college degree in August 2022, I decided to pack my bags and head out to America, specifically New York City in search of a new experience.
                And that is where I am now. There is limitless amounts of opportunity in New York that I can avail of.
                I am in search of a frontend Software Engineering role, so that I can further improve upon my skills while also learning from some great colleagues and tech enthusiasts alike.
